Sales-Forecasting
==============================

Prediction of 3 months of item-level sales data at 10 different store locations.

This project maes use of [darts](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/index.html) for time series analysis and prediction.

This project is mostly a learning exercise to acclimate myself with use of darts for analysis, and therefore a focus is placed on the analysis portion, with data being provided from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data).

The best score (12.58013) was generated from an N-BEATS deep learning model with Optuna hyperparameter tuning.

This model actually slightly outperformed the winning Kaggle score (12.58015), although there has been four years of devlopment since the competition was published!


The project repo is fairly empty, as it has been made with the cookiecutter package.
The notebooks folder actually contains the analysis.

I may pick this project up in future to create a proper report or saved trained model.
